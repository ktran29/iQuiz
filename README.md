# iQuiz

## Assignment
This is a multiple-choice Q&A application. Users can choose from a selection of quizzes, that each have a set number of questions. Each question has a multiple-choice answer, and users progress through questions one at a time, tracking their scores.

When a user selects a quiz, they go through question and answer screens; once there are no more questions, the user is taken to the finish screen where they will know how well they did on the quiz. From there, the user is taken back to the main screen to continue taking quizzes.

If at any point a user decides to abandon the quiz, swiping left will take them back to the initial screen.
